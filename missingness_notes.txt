# Missing Data

## Missingness Assumptions
MCAR - p(missing) is unrelated to all variable observed & unobserved
	p(missing|complete data) = p(missing)

MAR - p(missing) is related to observed variables only
	p(missing|complete data) = p(missing|observed data)

MNAR - p(missing) is related to the unobserved/missing variables
	p(missing|complete data) != p(missing|observed data)


X: complete data
Y: incomplete data
R: missing (0), observed (1)

Can't test whether a dataset is MAR vs MNAR. MAR <-> MNAR is on a continuum

Most techniques follow an MAR assumption

Techniques
- Listwise deletion: delete all observations where there's any missing data
- Pairwise deletion: NEED TO LOOK UP. Mentions correlations
- Adhoc single imputatation
	- Mean imputations: biased under MCAR
	- Hot deck imputation. Use a similar donor
	- Regression imputation: use regression equation derived from observed cases
- Multiple imputation: :-)
	- Step 1: Impute repeatedly (add stochastic component to regression line + error)
	- Step 2: Take m imputed datasets from step 1 & run regression on each of the datasets
	- Step 3: Average parameter estimate from the m regressions form above & compute standard error
- Maximum likelihood: :-)
	- Full Informatoin Maximum Likelhood (FIML)
	- EM Algorithm
- Sensitivity analysis (bleh)
